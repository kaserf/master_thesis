\chapter*{Abstract}
Data collected during debugging is traditionally rendered as text. The special application field of robotics faces problems with this approach, since a typical robotic system constantly gathers and processes data from the surrounding environment through sensors. Robotic applications are also hard to interrupt during debugging, since robots generally don't run in a deterministic and suspendable environment. Developers of robotic applications are confronted with high amounts of data during debugging, which becomes hard to interpret if the data is represented as text and high amounts of data need to be interpreted at once. This thesis tries to solve this problem by introducing a visual debugging system to support debugging of robotic applications: It takes into account the special requirements for a debugging tool in a robotic development environment, especially the uninterrupted rendering of debugging data and the need for better visualization of data to support a faster interpretation of data. The goal of the developed system is to help developers understand the data during debugging more quickly and improve overall productivity during robot development. To achieve the goal a system was designed and developed where developers can choose how they want to visualize data collected during debugging of a robotic application. This work presents the system design and a prototypical implementation of the proposed system. Evaluating the hypothesis that the developed system can improve productivity during debugging is out of scope for this work but the developed tool provides a solid base for further evaluations.
