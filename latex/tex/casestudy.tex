\chapter{Case Study}
Describe the case study: two different steps, the first one without code modification (monitoring of existing communication channels), the second one where code is actually modified to emit special debugging messages (can be done with rosdashboards api or manually).

Talk to Jamie Diprose about his Nao work with ROS (probably better than the turtlesim example from the ICRA paper), or see if rosbag data can be found and build showcase on top of the rosbag data.
