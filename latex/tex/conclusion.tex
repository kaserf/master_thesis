\section{Improving ROSDashboard}
\subsection{Interface Improvements}
\subsection{Plugin Framework}
\subsection{Exchangeable Data Providers}
Discuss how tracepoints could be used and how this could be adapted to other robot frameworks by encapsulating the data collection part (subscribe to topics and visualize new data).
\subsection{Transparent Debugging}
Discuss the possibilities to implement a regex parser that can parse through existing (text) log messages and pick out data or extending the ros logging framework to allow logging with type information.
\subsection{RQT Integration}

\section{Evaluation}
How could the tool be evaluated: large case study on a big project with fake bugs, use the tool during the development of a real robot and document benefits.

\section{Conclusion}
