\subsection{rxbag}
rxbag does something similiar we do: visualize data. It visualizes data from a bag file: you can see image data in a picture-stream way, plot numerical data and look at raw messages. You can also write plugins for more visualizations. The downside is that it only operates on pre-collected data sets (bags) and not on live data. This would be interesting to explore further, to visualize data live and collect the data for later analysis (combining rxbag with rosdashboard). This would not be a big problem, because collecting the bag file while we are visualizing is not a problem.
