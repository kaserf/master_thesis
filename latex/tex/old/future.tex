\begin{itemize}
\item more psychological backends
\item ***adapt categories***

\begin{itemize}
\item not only scaffolding, maybe there is a need of domain specific instruction
principles
\end{itemize}
\item personal agents (gender based?)

\begin{itemize}
\item agents can be given a kind of personality: the child defines what
the agent looks like, what his hobbies are, ...
\item agents modify themselfes regarding to the information the child provided:
gender, age, interests
\end{itemize}
\item evaluation

\begin{itemize}
\item field study
\item proof that the system works and improves learning
\end{itemize}
\item ui experiments

\begin{itemize}
\item usability of agents that are sometimes visible and sometimes not
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
