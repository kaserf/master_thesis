\section{INTRODUCTION}

\begin{itemize}[Introduction:]

\item initial approach to integrate tracepoints?
\item different approach to debug
\item making printf debugging better
\item current problems with robot debugging

\end{itemize}

Debugging complex robotic systems has proven to be more difficult then debugging normal (still complex) systems [citation]. One of the biggest problems when debugging robotic systems is the non-interruptible nature of robotic applications. Sometimes it is hard or even impossible to interrupt the execution of a robot without being a thread to the robot hardware and the persons and equipment in the environment where the robot is deployed. For example you can not just interrupt a quad-copter in mid-flight to step through the algorithm to find a bug. [citation?]

One approach to address this issue is to keep two separated controllers: a low level controller that keeps the essential parts of the robot running (e.g. keep the quad-copter flying) and a high level controller that runs the application logic code which is debugged. This only solves part of the problem because developing the low level controller is still not interruptible.

Another approach has come up in the past and it is more thorough, the concept of tracepoints [cite tracepoints] was used to debug a robot application without interrupting the execution but analysing the trace post-mortem (and more recently also viewing the results live [cite luke gumbley]. Using tracepoints to debug a program is a highly instrumented way of debugging and does not require a modification of the source code. However the tracepoints approach is quite complex and pre-execution configuration takes a substantial effort and skill, which many developers won't like to take upon them. [badly written, rewrite, no proof]

\section{RELATED WORK}

\begin{itemize}[Related work:]

\item ROS
\item LabView
\item tracepoints?

\end{itemize}

\subsection{ROS - Robot Operating System}

ROS foo

\subsection{LabView}

LabView has similar draggable widgets to make the development of systems easier.

\subsection{Tracepoints?}

Are tracepoints still that relevant to my work to list it here?

\section{ROSDASHBOARD}

Design, approach, integration, ROS philosophy...

\begin{itemize}

\item design (requirements)
\item approach
\item integration
\item ROS philosophy

\end{itemize}

\section{THEORETICAL BACKGROUND}

This section probably is nonsense. I wanted to get into detail about the fast feedback loop, small changes to the code, how it affects the debugging and development style in general, small product increments, ...

   \end{figure}
   

\section{FUTURE WORK}


\begin{itemize}

\item plugin structure
\item integrate into RQT
\item more widgets
\item widget designer (small python snippets?)
\item evaluation in real project

\end{itemize}

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

Do I need this section? What should I conclude about? Alternative approach to debugging? Fast feedback prototyping? (There was no evaluation so this section might be obsolete)

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
